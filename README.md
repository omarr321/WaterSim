# WaterSim
## About
This is a simulation that demonstrates water crystalizing to ice. It does so by creating water molecules and puts them into a box. The water will rotate over the course of the simulation and will try to bond to each other. After the simulation is complete, the program displays a 3D graph.
## TO-DO (in no order)
- Fix the bug where graphs do not save propely
- Optimize the drawing of the graph to make it less laggy on bigger graphs.
  - This would be done when the graph is loaded into JavaFX so any loaded graph would be optmized and would prevent data loss
- Add a way to add a legend to the graph
- Add a help page that tells you how to save a graph in a format that my program could read
  - This would be done after the rest of the stuff is done
## How to run
1. Make sure you have at least Java 16 installed on your machine. If you do not, follow [this](https://studyopedia.com/java/install-java-jdk-16-windows-10/) tutorial to install Java 16
0. Download ```WaterSim.zip``` from [here](https://github.com/omarr321/WaterSim/releases/2.0.0)
0. Extract the zip file
0. Open the folder ```WaterSim```
0. In the same folder, run ```run.bat```
0. Enjoy!
